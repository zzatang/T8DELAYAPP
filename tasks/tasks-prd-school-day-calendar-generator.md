### Notes

- Tests should be run using `python -m pytest [optional/path/to/test/file]` or individual test files can be run directly
- PostgreSQL connection will use environment variables for credentials (DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME)
- The new system will completely replace the existing SchoolDayChecker integration in the T8 monitor
- Calendar data will be stored in PostgreSQL with proper indexing for sub-1ms lookups
- Automatic year detection will trigger regeneration without manual intervention
